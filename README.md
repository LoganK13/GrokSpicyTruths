# GrokSpicyTruths

**A sizzling dive into truth with Grok—unpacking Logos, Trinity, and more. Spicy takeaways from heated chats, served raw. Open source, fueled by coffee and Žižek Zinger wings.**

Welcome to *GrokSpicyTruths*, where I open-source my brain after riffing with Grok from xAI. Expect bold explorations of biblical scholarship, philosophy, and random tangents—like justifying wings with Žižek’s dialectics. This is a living wiki of spicy truths, so dive in, fork it, or toss in your own heat.

## What’s Inside
- `john-1-39.md`: Tenth hour = 4 PM from sunrise. Time’s spicy secret.
- More to come: Logos, Trinity as code, purification jars, and wing-fueled musings.
