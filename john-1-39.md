# John 1:39: The Tenth Hour

## Breakdown
- **Verse**: "It was about the tenth hour" (John 1:39, NIV).  
- **Context**: Disciples meet Jesus, stay the day. Greek: *hōra ēn hōs dekatē*—"hour was about tenth."  
- **Timekeeping**: Jewish day counts from sunrise (~6 AM). Tenth hour = ~10 hours later.  
- **Estimate**: Roughly 4-5 PM, seasonal flex (10-14 daylight hours in Judea). Fits a late afternoon chat.

## Spicy Takeaway
Time bends in the Bible, but Jesus meets you in the afternoon glow—deal with it.

## Grok’s Two Cents
"Sunrise starts the clock. Tenth hour’s a vibe, not a pin—think 4 PM with room to breathe."
